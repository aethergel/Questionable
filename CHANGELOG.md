- Auto sync before pull fate mobs by alydev

Thank you for testing Questionable!
This update has a change to how mob targeting works, particularly with regard to FATEs.
Please report any issues you encounter with mob targeting to the discord, preferably with a screenshot showing:
- the quest you're on
- any affected mobs
- ideally with Enable combat data overlay turned on
