# Companion Plugins

This plugin relies on other tools to function optimally.

## Required

Each of the following plugins is required for specific reasons:

- ### [vnavmesh](https://github.com/awgil/ffxiv_navmesh)  
Handles in-zone navigation. It enables your character to move seamlessly from one quest objective to the next.

- ### [LifeStream](https://github.com/NightmareXIV/Lifestream)  
Proper fast-travel functionality within cities using Aetherytes and Aethernet Shards.

- ### [TextAdvance](https://github.com/NightmareXIV/TextAdvance)  
Automated quest interactions, including accepting and turning in quests as well as skipping cutscenes and dialogue.

## Optional

The following plugins enable extra functionality in Questionable.

### Combat Automation

For rotation/combat automation, select one of these plugins. Questionable recommends and actively works with the developers of Boss Mod (VBM) and Wrath Combo to ensure the best experience for users of this plugin, but other options are supported.

- ### [Boss Mod (VBM)](https://github.com/awgil/ffxiv_bossmod)
A plugin that provides boss fight radar, auto-rotation, cooldown planning, and AI. All of its modules can be toggled individually.

> [!WARNING]
> Forks of Boss Mod, such as BossMod Reborn, are not supported by Questionable, and will likely lead to issues.

- ### [Wrath Combo](https://github.com/PunishXIV/WrathCombo)
Wrath Combo is a heavily enhanced version of the XIVCombo plugin, offering highly customisable features and options to allow users to have their rotations be as complex or simple as possible, even to the point of a single button; for PvE, PvP, and more.

- ### [Rotation Solver Reborn](https://github.com/FFXIV-CombatReborn/RotationSolverReborn)
RotationSolverReborn is a community-made fork of the original RotationSolver plugin for Final Fantasy XIV. This tool is designed to enhance your gameplay experience by performing your rotation as optimally as possible, including heals, interrupts, mitigations, and MP management.

### Other Features

The following plugins are recommended, but not required.

- ### [CBT (formerly known as Automaton)](https://github.com/Jaksuhn/Automaton)
CBT is a tweak collection plugin that largely focuses on automating small and frequent tasks. Questionable uses it for the "Sniper No Sniping" tweak, which automatically completes sniping tasks introduced in Stormblood.

- ### [Pandora's Box](https://github.com/PunishXIV/PandorasBox)
Pandora's Box is a tweak collection plugin. Questionable uses it for the "Auto Active Time Maneuver" tweak, which automatically completes active time maneuvers in duties.

- ### [NotificationMaster](https://github.com/NightmareXIV/NotificationMaster)
NotificationMaster is a plugin for configuring out-of-game notifications for game events.

- ### [Artisan](https://github.com/PunishXIV/Artisan)
Artisan is a plugin for automating crafting. Questionable uses it for quests that involve crafting.

- ### [AutoDuty](https://github.com/ffxivcode/AutoDuty)
AutoDuty is a plugin that serves as a tool to assist in the creation and following of paths through dungeons and duties. Questionable uses it to automate the completion of duties that are required for certain quests.
